# nipype-neurodesk-workflows
A collection of Nipype workflows tested on Neurodesk.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure that you have Docker or Podman installed (if you plan to use the full Neurodesk setup).
- Familiarity with Jupyter Lab.

### System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Check minimum RAM and minimum free Disk Space

### Running the Notebooks
1. Set up Neurodesk by following the instructions [here](https://www.neurodesk.org/) under **Get started with Neurodesk**.
2. Alternatively, you can use [Neurodesk Play](https://www.neurodesk.org/docs/getting-started/neurodesktop/play/) if you want to quickly try out Neurodesktop without installing docker or signing in.
3. Clone this repository or download individual notebooks.
4. Launch Neurodesk or Neurodesk Play. Different ways are provided from transfering the notebooks in and out of Neurodesk/ Neurodesk Play, to [drag-and-drop](https://www.neurodesk.org/docs/getting-started/neurodesktop/storage/#drag-and-drop) to [cloud storage](https://www.neurodesk.org/docs/getting-started/neurodesktop/storage/#cloud-storage).
5. Open the desired notebook in Jupyter Lab and run the cells. 

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve existing notebooks or add new ones, please feel free to submit a pull request.
